# TDD Bank Account

## TDD Manifesto Excercise 6

Note: This is an advanced example where the solution requires knowledge of using a mocking framework. The possible solution can also have an elaborated design. Solve it only if you feel comfortable with mocking frameworks and designing your code.

Create a simple bank application with features of depositing, withdrawing, and printing account statements.
Constraints

1. Start with a class with the following structure

public class Account {
  public void deposit(int amount)
  public void withdraw(int amount)
  public void printStatement()
}

2. You are not allowed to add any other public methods in this class

3. Use Strings and Integers for dates and amounts (keep it simple)

4. Donâ€™t worry about the spacing in the statement printed in the console

### Requirements

1. Deposit into Account
2. Withdraw from an Account
3. Print the Account statement to the console

### Additional requirements added by me

1. Initial balance is 0.00
2. Each additional deposit increases the balance accordingly.
3. Any withdrawal that would decrease the balance below 0 is not allowed
