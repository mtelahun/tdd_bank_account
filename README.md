# TDD Bank Account
Note: This is an advanced example where the solution requires knowledge of using a mocking framework. The possible solution can also have an elaborated design. Solve it only if you feel comfortable with mocking frameworks and designing your code.

Create a simple bank application with features of depositing, withdrawing, and printing account statements.
Constraints

1. Start with a class with the following structure

public class Account {
  public void deposit(int amount)
  public void withdraw(int amount)
  public void printStatement()
}

2. You are not allowed to add any other public methods in this class

3. Use Strings and Integers for dates and amounts (keep it simple)

4. Donâ€™t worry about the spacing in the statement printed in the console
